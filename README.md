# mAIgic

## Project Description
**mAIgic** is an AI-powered assistant designed to enhance productivity and organization by tracking messages and important information across multiple platforms. It identifies and reminds users about follow-ups, ensuring timely responses and efficient information management. With intelligent search capabilities, mAIgic enables users to easily locate conversations and details tied to specific individuals or tasks.

The project supports popular platforms such as Slack, Trello, Gmail, and Google Chat, providing seamless follow-up tracking, reminders, and contextual search across these communication channels. This integration leverages AI to automate the reminder process, making it easier to stay on top of essential follow-ups and tasks.

## Features
- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Static code analysis with `ruff` (linter)
- Type checking with `mypy`
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline with CircleCI, running both tests and static analysis automatically on every push.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mAIgic.git
cd mAIgic
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Alternatively, if using the `uv` package manager:
```bash
uv sync
```

The above command will create a virtual environment `.venv` and install all the dependencies from the `uv.lock` file. Activate the environment by executing
```bash
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

## Running Tests

### 1. Pytest
You can run unit tests using `pytest` by running the following command:
```bash
pytest tests
```

**Example Tests in `tests/test_samples.py`:**
- Basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- String operations (case-insensitive checks)
- List and dictionary operations
- Exception handling tests (checking for specific exceptions)

### 2. Ruff (Linter)
Use `ruff` to run static analysis (linting) on your code:
```bash
ruff check .
```

### 3. Mypy (Type Checking)
To perform static type checking using `mypy`, run:
```bash
mypy .
```

## CircleCI Configuration

The project is integrated with CircleCI for continuous integration. Every push to the repository automatically triggers the following steps:
1. **Install dependencies**: Installs `pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.
2. **Run tests**: Executes all tests in the `tests/` folder using `pytest`.
3. **Run static analysis**: Runs `ruff` for linting and `mypy` for type checking.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors:
1. **Missing Dependencies**: If any dependency-related issues arise, ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   uv init
   ```
