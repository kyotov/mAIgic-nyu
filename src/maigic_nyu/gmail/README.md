# mAIgic - Gmail module

This module can be used to communicate with Gmail account. With appropriate credentials, one can access the respective Gmail account's content. The module supports 2 operations as of now:

- Fetch a specific email.
- Fetch all emails.

There are multiple classes that can effectively represent an email and more importantly, its metadata. The metadata includes the following:

- Labels
- Headers
- Attachments
- Thread id
  etc.

# Technical tools

- Programming Language: Python
- Project dependency management tool: uv
- Project linter: ruff
- Project tester: pytest
- Continuous Integration (CI) tool: circleCI

# Instructions

Collaboration doc for this initiative: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1duhM5Ufkq_doBnMvHo65S7cplmUJw4KqQvDRfZlmj7s/edit

## Setup

- Install `uv` on your system with command with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.
- `cd` into the cloned repository and execute `uv sync --extra dev` (This will install all the project and developer dependencies).
- Activate the environment `venv` by executing `source ./.venv/bin/activate`.

## Processes

- To check the formatting standard with ruff (linter) execute either `uv run ruff check .` or `ruff check .` from the root directory of the project.
- To test the code, execute either `uv run pytest .` or `pytest .` from the root directory of the project.

Note: One can run tools like ruff and pytest independently or can run them through `uv`.

## Commit Style Guide

- Request to `strictly adhere` to the suggested commit style guide.
- The project follows Udacity's [Commit Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).
- Reason:
  - It is simple, elegant, concise and effective.
  - It does not have many rules that could create confusion but yet have just enough to keep things working smoothly through clear and concise communication.

## GitHub Workflow

- Members of same team can preferably `clone` the repository.
- Make sure to push new changes to `dev` remote branch.
- Create a `Pull Request` and the changes would be reviewed and merged to the `main` remote branch. `Review` includes code, code quality, code standards, commit style guides, and Pull Request descriptions. Consistent code standards and documentation would be aided by `ruff`.
- `main` branch serves as production branch which would accumulate new changes, features and bug-fixes from `dev` branch.
- Would appreciate if you open `issues` whenever you come across any. Issues can be bugs, proposed features, performance / code improvement proposals, etc.

## Requesting access to project and CI space

- Send your`github username` to become collaborators to the project.
- Send your `email id` used to `register with circleCI` to get access to the circleCI organization to manage CI workflows and triggers. You will receive an invitation in the provided email's inbox to join the circleCI organization.
- Currently, the `magic2` CircleCI project is attached to this project.

Note: Request to keep all `communication` in the Google Chats Project Group.
